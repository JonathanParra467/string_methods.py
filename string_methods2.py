"""step 1:There is a Python file string_methods2.py Download string_methods2.pythat you need to download. This file contains several TODO comments, each indicating a small task for you to complete.

Step 2: Complete the Exercises
Open string_methods2.py in your favorite Python editor. For each TODO comment in the file, write the necessary Python code to complete the task. These tasks are designed to give you hands-on experience with different string methods.

Step 3: Test Your Code
After writing your code for each task, run the file to test your solutions. Make sure each part of the exercise works as expected. If you encounter errors, try to debug and fix them.

Step 4: Upload to GitHub
Once you are confident that your code works correctly, upload the string_methods2.py file to your existing GitHub repository. If you're new to GitHub, remember to 'commit' your changes and 'push' them to the repository.

Step 5: Submit Your Work
 After uploading the file to GitHub, copy the URL of the file in your GitHub repository. Submit this link as your assignment. Make sure the link you submit goes directly to the string_methods2.py file in your GitHub repository."""

# TODO: Use the capitalize() method to capitalize the first letter of the string
# Example: "python" -> "Python"
string1 = "python"
# Your code here

# Example: "python" -> "  python  "
string2 = "python"
# Your code here
